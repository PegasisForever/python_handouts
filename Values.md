# Values

You already known the concept of values in *Basic Terms*, now we are going to learn more about it and learn how to write it in a way that machine can understand.

## Value Types

You cannot mention value without mentioning value types. Value types describes what category the value is.

Here are some common types:

- **Number**: Don’t need to explain this much, but notice there are many kind of numbers (decimal numbers, integers, super big integers and so on). They are actually different types. But, you only need to know they are numbers.
- **String**: It’s definition is “a sequence of characters”, it can be only one character, a word, a sentence, or even a book. (It can be blank too)
- **Boolean**: If a value’s type is Boolean, it can only be True or False.

## How to Write a Value

- **Number**: Numbers don’t need to write in a special way, for example `1`, `1000`, `20.5` are all correct
- **String**: In order to persent a string, you need to add quotation mark to it. For example you want to write a value *test*, you need to code `"test"`. `"I love you"`, `"a"`, `""`(blank string) are all correct.
- **Boolean**: Boolean type is either `True` or `False`.
