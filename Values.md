# Values

You already known the concept of values in *Basic Terms*, now we are going to learn more about it and learn how to write it in a way that machine can understand.

## Value Types

You cannot mention value without mentioning value types. Value types describes what category the value is.

Here are some common types:

- **Number**: Don’t need to explain this much.
- **String**: It’s definition is “a sequence of characters”, it's text. it can be only one character, a word, a sentence, or even a book. (It can be blank too)
- **Boolean**: If a value’s type is Boolean, it can only be True or False.

## How to Write a Value

- **Number**: Numbers don’t need to write in a special way, for example `1`, `1000`, `20.5` are all correct
- **String**: In order to present a string, you need to add quotation mark to it. For example you want to write a value *test*, you need to code `"test"`. `"I love you"`, `"a"`, `"123"`, `""`(blank string) are all correct.
- **Boolean**: Boolean type is either `True` or `False`.

## Difference between `5` and `"5"`

This is a question that a lot of students are confused about. `5` is a number, it can add with other numbers for example `5 + 1` will give you `6`. `"5"` is a string, which is a text. You can't add it to numbers, but you can add it to other strings, for example `"5" + "test"` will give you `"5test"`, `"5" + "1"` will give you `"51"`.
