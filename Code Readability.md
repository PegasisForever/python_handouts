# Code Readability

You already wrote a lot of code, but if they are hard to read, it's hard to let others to understand your work or add new features to it.

## Comments

Comments will be ignored when your code is running. It's only for people to read. Single line comments start with a `#`.

Multi-line comments start with `"""` and end with another `"""`.

If you don't want some lines of code to run, just put a `#` in front of it, turn it into a comment. If you want to restore this code, just delete the `#`.

## Blank Lines

Don't pile all of your code together. Use Blank Lines to divide different parts of your code. For example:

<iframe src="https://test.pegasis.site/python/editor.html?fileName=1559273090" width="100%" height="366px" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

In this case, I used two blank lines to divide data define section, check name section and check age section.

## Do We Really Need Code Readability?

The answer is **YES**. You may think you can understand your code without any comments or blank lines. Yea... I thought like this when I first learned programming too. But after one month don't touching your code, you will find out that you have not even a clue what you were writing about.
